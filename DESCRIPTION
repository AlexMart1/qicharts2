Description: Shewhart control charts and run charts for process control and
    improvement. Included charts are: I, MR, Xbar, S, T, C, U, P, G, 
    and run charts. Run charts use the Anhoej rules for identification of 
    non-random variation in the form of persistens shifts in data over time.
    In addition to the Anhoej rules, control charts use Shewhart's 3-sigma rule
    to identify special cause variation in the form of sudden, large, possibly
    transient shifts in data.
