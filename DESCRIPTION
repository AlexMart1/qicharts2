Description: Run charts and Shewhart control charts for process control and
    improvement. Included control charts are: I, MR, Xbar, S, T, C, U, U', P, 
    P', and G charts. Non-random variation in the form of minor to moderate
    persistens shifts in data over time is identified by the Anhoej rules for
    unusually long runs and unusually few crossing. Special cause variation in
    the form of larger, possibly transient shifts in data is identified by
    Shewhart's 3-sigma rule.
