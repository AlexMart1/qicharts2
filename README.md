# Quality improvement charts for R

Run charts and Shewhart control charts for process control and improvement. Included control charts are: I, MR, Xbar, S, T, C, U, U', P, P', and G charts. 

Non-random variation in the form of minor to moderate persistens shifts in data over time is identified by the Anhoej rules for unusually long runs and unusually few crossing.

Special cause variation in the form of larger, possibly transient shifts in data is identified by Shewhart's 3-sigma rule.
